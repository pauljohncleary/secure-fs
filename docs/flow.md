Sender:
- Open page
- Send file button / drag n drop & shareable link shows up
- Select file
- Add password (opt)
- Send link to peer for download and password in a separate channel
- Peer connects

Peer:
- open Link
- prompted for password (opt)
- password is hashed and sent over webrtc and validated on the sender's machine
- webrtc transaction begins and file is sent directly to the other user


When you land on the page you should be able to share the link, add the file, password etc.

We have a separate area that's grey until the peer arrives
